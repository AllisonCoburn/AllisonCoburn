             	 <!-- actual project-->
                 <p> For this part of our project, we are beginning to prototype a design to solve the problem we have defined.</p>
                 <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Resources </h1>
                 <p> </p>
             	 <p> The resources we believe we need for this project are linked in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jggXgD1h9Pz74lPPZ1Hh-u_tCgPx0u0ALmFqtUNRgUI/edit?usp=sharing ">google document</a>. </p> 
                     <p> </p>
      <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Needs Statement: </h1>
                     <p> Blind dogs need a way to navigate so that they can be safe and independent.  </p>
                    <p> </p>
                <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Key Features of Product: </h1>
                <p> </p>
            <p><center> 1. Customizable Measurement —Something that extends past dogs furthest point on face (nose). → Measure specific dogs since nose size can vary from dog to dog even if they are the same breed. Include clear instructions on how to measure and what to measure.  </center></p>
                 <p><center> 2. Sturdy —Can stand force, does not move around too much, is not likely to break as the dog moves around. </center></p>
                <p><center> 3. Removable —if stuck on something can come off, will not choke / hurt the dog  </center></p>
                <p><center> 4. Comfort—does not cause too much discomfort, allows dogs to continue their way of life without the product acting as a burden, has a learning curve that allows dog to eventually use the product properly and comfortably.   </center></p>
                 <p> </p>
                 <h3><u>Drawing: </u></h3>
                 <p> </p>
                   <center><img src="HaloDrawing.png " alt="..." /></center> 
                <p> </p>
                 <p> Our first drawing was this. Our plan being to attach the tool to the dogs harness (a cheap/assessible item a dog owner may already own), we needed a way for it to fit. As well as it needed to stretch past the dog's head. Our plan was to tie velcro to the notches at the bottom of the item and attach that velcro to a velcro that was glued onto the harness. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="Halo1.png " alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p> We created and printed this as a quick fusion360 version of the goal. While it looked nice, it most certainly would not have been long enough to stop the dog from hitting its head on objects around it. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> So, we made it longer and reprinted it.  </p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="Halo2.png " alt="..." /></center>
                 <p> </p>
                 <p>To test the design, we printed a dog and an item for the dog that wrapped around its neck (the part where the piece we created would attach to) to mimic a part of a harness. This step also allowed us to get started on how someone might have to tweak the design to better fit their own dog.  </p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="DogPrint.png " alt="..." /></center>
                <p> Note: Due to the very small size of the dog model we printed, we did not tie the velcro to our design. Instead we used the stickiness the velcro came with and attached it that way. This definitely would not be sturdy enough for a real-life dog.  </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> We thought, though, that the design was too sturdy. Meaning, when hit hard, it did not have enough flex and as a result would hurt the dog.  </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> To try to counteract this, we thought we should try making the design more squiggly. </p>
                <center><img src="HaloFail.png " alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Sadly, the one print we had a chance to print failed. But, as you can see from the right side, it was much more squiggly than our original design. </p>
                <p> </p>
