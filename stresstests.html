                 <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Stress Test #1 </h1>
                 <p> For my first stress test, I decided to print a spring. I thought it would be good to test since springs have a lot of overhang. The model I decided to use already had a base included. This print definitely would not have been possible without it. No way the spring could have stood on its own. </p>

                <p> </p>
                <p>The 3D print came out very well! It definitely looks like the model I used. However, it did have some zitting. The base also did have some gaps between the infill and outline. However, that is okay since the base was only there to support the spring and was meant to be removed after printing successfully.
                <p> </p>

                <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Stress Test #2 </h1>
                <p> I decided to do a second stress test since I thought my first one did very well and did not have a lot go wrong. I decided to print a heart with gaps and small pieces. </p>
                <p> </p>
                    <center><img src="file:///Users/allisoncoburn/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202024-01-23%20at%2010.46.38%20AM.png" alt="..." /></center>
                  <p> </p>
                <p>As you can see in the picture below, the project failed very early on (10% in). The base did not successfully attach to the bed. I think the reason this happened was because the print did not have enough surface area to print onto. If I wanted to retry to print this piece, I would add a brim or a raft to fix this. The piece I printed was small with many gaps, making the pieces that were being printed onto even smaller. </p>
