             	 <!-- actual project-->
             	 <p> This is the first project I 3D printed! I loaded a file into Prusa slicer and edited the design to have my name with a "<3". I then exported the file as gcode into a flashdrive so I could begin to print using a Prusa MINI+ 3D Printer. </p> 
             	 	<p> </p>
             	 	<p> After finding my project on the printer, I began to follow the instructions the printer gave me. I found loading the filament very confusing because I didn’t realize I needed to keep pushing the filament in after pushing it in italitally. After noticing the filament clearly being seen through the tube in other people’s printers, I knew I was missing something. I learned I had to keep pushing the filament in until I felt the machine grab it. </p>

             	 <p> </p>

				<p> Overall, the project turned out amazing! I love the colors and the project for the most part definitely looks like what it was supposed to! However, I had a problem when switching the color of the filament. I misunderstood what the 3D printer asked (likely because I was nervous) and pressed yes when the filament was not fully loaded yet. As a result, my printer started printing without filament for about a minute before I could get a teacher over to help me stop it. I pressed pause but it did not pause. The teacher pressed stop on the printer which finally made it stop. As a result, the border of the filament did not properly attach to the rest of the piece, as you can tell in the picture. Also, the heart (<3) I tried to print did not print well at all. Like the letters, it came out very thin. Though, the letters did come out thin, they can pass as complete in my opinion. But, the heart is fully missing part of it. Luckily, I was able to take it off easily by simply pulling on it. Another issue is that the letters had some stringing. But again, just like the heart, it came off fairly easily. </p>
